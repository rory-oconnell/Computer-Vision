# Part II. 
# Locate the table tennis table.  You must now locate the corners of the table (the outside of the white lines) 
# using edge detection, and then transform the image so that you have a plan view of the table.  
# Determine how well your approach works on the static images of the tables provided 
# (See https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Kenneth.Dawson-Howe/Vision/tables.zip for the table images with ground truth).  
# Ensure that you use techniques which can be used in general (e.g. ideally the techniques would cope with changes in lighting, etc.).  
# Analyse how well your approach works on the static images of the tables provided, and later on the table tennis video.  
# Note that in the report you may need to use some of the Learning and Evaluation section of the course, 
# also in section 9.3 of “Computer Vision with OpenCV”  (when reporting performance).
